        Spokane Public Libraryâ€™s reciprocal agreement with Spokane County Library District allows County residents a library card at no charge. Reciprocal cards do not allow access to some library services including Inter-library loan and subscription database access. For access to subscription databases, a non-resident card fee is available. See any staff member to learn more about this option.
