	Are you doing research from outside the greater Spokane area?
</p>
<p>
	We will search for three announcements at a time and will search the newspaper for 5 days after an event date. 
	You may interlibrary loan a microfilm copy of the newspaper from the State Library if you wish to continue the search yourself.
