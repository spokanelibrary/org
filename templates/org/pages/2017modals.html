                        &ldquo;The arts are an essential element of every community.  In the west the arts don&rsquo;t get the support they need.  I feel very deeply that the arts need to be supported and that they must flourish if we are to endure as a successful community.  Some people don&rsquo;t get that.  We need the arts for a lot of reasons, but most desperately we need them so that we can see, think about, and understand ourselves.&rdquo;

                    <p>Tom Armitage has been a respected educator at North Central High School since 1979. Over the course of his time at North Central, Armitage directed 70 plays in the theater department. Some of his biggest accomplishments include the revival of North Central&rsquo;s The Doll Shop, a musical in which every student who tries out gets cast, and The True Colors Project, where students write personal essays and the cast turns those essays into a major production about the lives of the North Central students. He also does an &ldquo;etiquette con&rdquo; each year to teach teenagers appropriate behavior at events. He is a community builder who has impacted thousands of Spokane teens.</p>
<p>Armitage received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Radio/Television News from Eastern Washington University in 1977 and soon after went back to school to receive his degree in Education in 1979. He then earned his Master of Fine Arts Degree at the University of Idaho.

<p>Born in Spokane in 1954, the Armitage family was one of the first neighbors in the Indian Trail neighborhood. Tom Armitage attended Salk Junior High School and graduated from Shadle Park High School in 1973.</p>

                    <p>Sister Peter Claver, president and chief executive officer of Sacred Heart Hospital, was born in Terry, Montana as Lucille Thomas. She began her career as a registered nurse in Great Falls, Montana in 1938. She joined the Sisters of Providence in Seattle in 1939, choosing the name Peter Claver because she felt it signified strength. After completing her studies at the novitiate, Claver went back to school and work. She worked as a nurse in a number of locations and later completed a BS degree in nursing education from Gonzaga and a Masters in hospital administration from St. Louis University. Sacred Heart Hospital appointed her as Administrator in 1964. Under her direction, Sacred Heart expanded its budget from $7.4 million to $148 million, undertook three major building projects and increased the number of employees from 900 to 3,000. She served as president of the Washington State Hospital Association and the Northeastern Washington Hospital Council as well as numerous community boards including the United Way, the Junior League and the board of regents at Gonzaga. Though she ran one of the largest organizations in Spokane, she was paid $40 a month and made her own clothes. Her primary goal throughout her life was helping sick people. Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center & Children&rsquo;s Hospital presents a Sister Peter Claver Humanitarian Award every year to honor individuals who reflect Sister&rsquo;s compassion and humanitarian leadership.</p>

                    <p>Kirtland Cutter, Spokane&rsquo;s best-known architect, was born near Cleveland in 1860.  After attending schools in Cleveland, Cutter went to the Art Students&rsquo; League of New York where he studied illustration. From there, he traveled to Europe where he studied art, mainly in Dresden and Florence. He would later draw upon these European influences in his architecture. Cutter arrived in Spokane in 1886 and decided to practice architecture. His first designs were for his uncle, a prominent Spokane banker and himself. With the success of those homes, he designed homes for James Glover and F. Rockwood Moore and with those residential designs, he began a successful career of building homes for Spokane&rsquo;s elite. After most of downtown Spokane was destroyed in the 1889 fire, Cutter was established enough to help rebuild the city along with his partner, John C. Poetz. While Cutter provided the artistic designs, Poetz provided the technical expertise. After Poetz retired, Cutter began working with Karl G. Malmgren. Cutter designed many buildings in downtown Spokane including the First National Bank, the Rookery Building, the Sherwood Building, the Pedicord Hotel, the Spokane Club, the Crescent Store and of course, the Davenport Hotel, completed in 1914. Cutter also designed many prominent buildings in Seattle and Tacoma. In 1923, Cutter moved his practice to Southern California where he designed houses in Long Beach, Palos Verdes, Beverly Hills, and San Marino. Cutter practiced successfully in California until his death in 1939, at age 79 in Long Beach.</p>

                        &ldquo;My definition of happiness is having a job to do, enjoying doing it, and then getting it done.&rdquo;

                    <p>Aubrey White, the &ldquo;father of Spokane parks&rdquo; served as president of the Spokane Board of Park Commissioners for twenty years. He arrived in Spokane from his native Maine in 1889 at the age of 20. White spent his early career selling mining stocks and railroad bonds in Eastern cities. He was able to see that many cities had not left enough land for parks and when he returned to Spokane, he was determined that Spokane not make the same mistakes. His first project was to create Manito Park. Unable to convince the city government to add the donated acres of parkland, he focused on private sector assistance. In 1907, a public vote established a nonpartisan volunteer board of park commissioners and an annual park levy. White became the first president of the park board and hired the Olmstead Brothers firm to develop a park plan. While White was involved with many business activities, including real estate, banking, railroads and mining, he always found time for civic affairs. During the 1920s, White&rsquo;s business fortunes began to decline and he spent the last 26 years of his career as garden editor for the Spokesman Review, a position created for him by his friend, William H. Cowles.  Backed by the newspaper, he set about saving the Spokane River and as a result of his crusade, managed to make 80% of the river banks parkland. The Aubrey White Parkway was named for him for these efforts. He worked for the paper until shortly before his death in 1948.</p>
